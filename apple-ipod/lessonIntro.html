        In the late 90Â´s the only way to carry music with you legally was done by carrying a portable casette or CD player (Walkman/Diskman). Soon people started to copy their music collection to small files called MP3 and connecting their PCs to speakers listening to the music.
        Internet and peer-to-peer filesharing exploded and the first music sharing service, Napster, was launched in 1999.
        The market is big. Everyone loves music. Its a part of human nature, and it will always be so.
